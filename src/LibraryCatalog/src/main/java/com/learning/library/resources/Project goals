Library Catalog â€“ Create a book class with a title, page count, ISBN and whether or not it is checked out or not.
 Manage a collection of various books and allow the user to check out books or return books. 
 For added complexity generate a report of those books overdue and any fees. 
 Also allow users to put books on reserve.
 
 
 Next steps: 
 
 Create a basic user class
 	Name
 	Address
 	Phone
  	UID

 Modify Book
 	Convert checked out from bool to a method which checks the current userid to see if it's populated
 	Add a checked date
 	add a return policy
 	
Create a few users and add printmethods to them too

Check a few books out to users

Set up a date iteration loop to run through a few cycles

Find some way to trigger checkouts
  report failures when books are checked out
  add reservations.
  
Add a user driven console for adding books, checking things out and reserving

Add reports for users, books, overdue available.  Add filters for Genre and whatever else.
